# DSA210-Term-Project-LoL-Analysis
## Project Overview
This project investigates the effects of various player actions such as  vision score, total minion kills, and objective scores, on the win rate and rank in League of Legends. Additionally, the project compares the relation of having AFK players and early surrenders on teams in different ranks (high vs low). 

Simply by analyzing my own games and other low elo players, I want to emphazise what low elo players can improve and what are the major differences between low elo and high elo games.
