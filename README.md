# DSA210-Term-Project-LoL-Analysis
## Project Overview
This project investigates the effects of various player actions such as  vision score, total minion kills, and objective scores, on the win rate and rank in League of Legends. Additionally, the project compares the relation of having AFK players and early surrenders on teams in different ranks (high vs low). 

Simply by analyzing my own games and other low elo players, I want to emphazise what low elo players can improve and what are the major differences between low elo and high elo games.

## Motivation
I have been playing this game since 2012 and achieved the greatest rank which is Challeger. This idea is original and nothing like I have seen before. It will be a fun way of practing my data skills. Also, I will come up with significant results since I have experience in that game. I hope to:
- Realize my mistakes, so that I can improve my gameplay and be a better player.
- Use the data skills that I learnt in the class on something that I have passion.
- Create an original and unusual work.
